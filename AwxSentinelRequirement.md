## 1. Introduction & Overview

### Product Name
Airwallex Sentinel

### Tagline
"Life is too short to worry about fraud attacks... read a book, enjoy the view... Airwallex Sentinel has got you covered."

### Problem Statement
Merchants, particularly those with a global customer base, are constantly under threat from sophisticated and rapidly evolving fraud attacks. Manually analyzing and responding to these threats is time-consuming, requires specialized expertise, and often leads to a delay in mitigation, resulting in financial loss and operational inefficiency. The current system provides alerts, but the analysis and action still require significant manual intervention.

### Solution
Airwallex Sentinel is an AI-powered fraud attack prevention product that automatically analyzes risk alerts, immediately tests and deploys strategies to prevent the attack and provides an incident report with recommended next steps to protect merchants' accounts from future attacks. It empowers merchants with a one-click solution to deploy new rules and proactively protects their accounts. This product will leverage our existing fraud-fighting capabilities and package them into a user-friendly, automated product.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core Product & UI/UX Functionality

#### In-App Sentinel Notifications
- Push notifications and in-app alerts will be triggered when a P1 or P2 alert is generated by the risk engine.
- The notification will link directly to the Sentinel dashboard - Consider to embed into the core fraud and dispute dashboard.

#### Sentinel Dashboard
A dedicated section within the Airwallex merchant portal.

- **Alert Summary:** A concise, human-readable summary of the alert's findings, directly from the AI agent. This will mirror the format of the sample alerts provided:
  - **Raw Data:** A link to the underlying transaction data.
  - **Category:** e.g., Card Testing, Velocity Attack, False Positive.
  - **Result:** A full, formatted alert analysis with the Conclusion, Suggested Action, Urgency.

#### "One-Click Rule Deployment"
- A prominent, clearly labeled button that allows the merchant to immediately implement the AI-recommended rule.
- A confirmation modal will appear before deployment, summarizing the rule's impact.
- The system will track and log all rule deployments made via Sentinel.

#### Feedback Mechanism
A simple "Was this analysis helpful? (👍 / 👎)" button to collect feedback and train the AI model.

#### "Read a Book" View
A dynamic background or animated screen that appears after a rule is deployed, reinforcing the product's tagline and brand promise.

#### Upsell View
Could use this to upsell other product features or recommend other payment methods to explore? With the time we saved you, how about you explore XYZ

### 5.2 Analytics & Models Functionality (The Risk Engine)

#### Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Real-time ingestion of all payment-related data points: transaction details, card data (BIN), IP addresses, device IDs, customer IDs, emails, and transaction outcomes.
- Data must be cleaned and normalized for use by the AI models.

#### AI-Powered Alert Generation
- **Metric Monitoring:** The system will continuously monitor key metrics (block rate, auth failure rate, transaction volume) for sudden, significant spikes.
- **Triggering:** When a predefined threshold is breached, a P1 or P2 alert is generated.

#### AI Analysis Module (The Sentinel Agent)
Upon alert generation, this module will asynchronously process the raw data to produce a structured analysis.

**Behavioral & Concentration Analysis:**
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Use unsupervised learning to cluster transactions by suspicious attributes (e.g., shared card BINs, IP subnets, customer IDs, or a single email domain).
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify and classify common fraud typologies (Card Testing, Velocity, etc) based on the clustered data.

**Data Integrity Check:**
- Analyze fields for missing or null values.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) to detect "gibberish" or programmatic email patterns and to classify domains as "disposable."
- Check for high concentrations of `isAnonymous=true` flags.

**Leakage & Gap Analysis:**
- Query for transactions that were not blocked by our rules but failed at the issuer level.
- Run a secondary analysis on this subset to find common fraud traits.

**Structured Analysis Generation:**
- The final output will be a JSON object containing the Conclusion, Suggested Action, Urgency, which will be rendered in the front end.

#### Automated Rule Deployment Engine
- This component will act as a bridge between the AI recommendation and the core risk engine.
- When the "Deploy" button is clicked, it will translate the "Suggested Action" from the AI's JSON output into a new rule entry in the risk engine's database.

#### Continuous Learning & Feedback Loop
The AI model will be continuously retrained.

- **Explicit Feedback:** The 👍 / 👎 feedback from users will be a core input for model retraining.
- **Implicit Feedback:** The model will also learn from merchant behavior. If a merchant uses the "one-click deploy" button, it's a strong positive signal. If they choose to ignore an alert or manually override a rule, it's a negative signal.

## 6. Sentinel Scope

| Attack Category | Sentinel Detection Method |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Card Testing** | Monitors for high volumes of small, failed transactions originating from a single source (e.g., IP address, device ID, or card BIN). It can also detect patterns like sequential card numbers. |
| **Account Takeover** | Uses behavioral biometrics and anomaly detection to flag logins from new or suspicious locations, devices, or at unusual times. It also monitors for rapid changes to user profile information or payment details. |
| **Velocity Attacks** | Tracks transaction frequency and volume in real-time. It can alert on a sudden surge in transaction volume that exceeds historical norms for a particular merchant. |
| **Refund & Chargeback Fraud** | Analyzes refund and chargeback data to identify recurring patterns from the same customer or a group of customers. It can also compare this data against other fraud indicators to build a more comprehensive risk profile. |

## 7. Success Metrics

- **Merchant Adoption Rate:** % of active merchants who have enabled and used the Sentinel feature.
  - For Opt-in merchants, auto enable Airwallex Sentinel by default for them
- **False Positive Rate:** Reduction in false positives flagged by the AI compared to the previous manual process.
- **Time to Mitigate:** Reduction in the average time from alert generation to rule deployment.
- **Reduction in Fraud Loss:** Quantifiable reduction in chargeback rates and fraud losses for merchants using Sentinel.

### Mitigation Modes

#### "One-Click" Mitigation (User-Initiated Automation)
This is the scenario where the system detects a potential fraud attack (like card testing), generates a detailed alert, and provides a clear, concise summary with a recommended action. The merchant is notified and can then, with a single click, deploy the pre-packaged rule to stop the attack. This is a powerful feature for merchants who want to stay informed and have a say in their security, but still want the process to be as simple as possible.

#### "Auto-On" Mitigation (Fully Autonomous)
For well-defined, high-confidence attack vectors (e.g., a card testing attack that fits a known, aggressive pattern), Sentinel's AI can be configured to automatically deploy the recommended rule without requiring a merchant's one-click approval. The merchant receives a notification after the fact, informing them that a new rule has been deployed to protect their account and that the attack has been stopped. This is the ultimate "set-it-and-forget-it" feature and aligns perfectly with the tagline: "Life is too short to worry about fraud attacks... Airwallex Sentinel has got you covered."

### Key Features

- **Attack Alerts:** SMS, Email, Webapp
- **Auto enable reCaptcha:** accumulate 3 months data
- **Auto deploy rules**
- **AI Summary Fraud report**
- **X attack being blocked** → A rules deployed
- **Y for your review**
- **Beta merchants:** prone to get attacks

### Why This Distinction Matters

#### Fraud Attacks are Real-time
Sophisticated, bot-driven attacks like card testing happen in minutes, not hours. A delay of even a few minutes for a merchant to see a notification and take action can result in significant financial loss.

#### True Peace of Mind
The "auto-on" feature provides genuine peace of mind. The merchant doesn't have to be constantly monitoring their phone or email for alerts. They can trust that the system is proactively protecting their business, even while they are "reading a book" or "enjoying the view."

#### Operational Efficiency
This level of automation significantly improves operational efficiency for both the merchant and Airwallex's internal risk team by eliminating the need for any human intervention in certain, well-understood attack scenarios.
